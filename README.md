# Advent Of Code 2025


## Motivation
Yep, I'm finally doing it for real this time. All of my previous flaky attempts have been forgiven. 

## Programming Language

I'm using Rust, a really beginner friendly but slow language.  

## Contributing

### Create a directory for your work

```bash
mkdir -p day1/<your name>
```

### Get the puzzle input 

You can obtain your cookie header by:
1. Log in to Advent of Code
2. Navigate to the puzzle input page and view request via the network tab 
3. Copy the request header called "Cookie" 


Make this curl request: 
```bash
curl -o puzzle_input.txt --cookie "<your cookie header>" https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/<day>/input
```
